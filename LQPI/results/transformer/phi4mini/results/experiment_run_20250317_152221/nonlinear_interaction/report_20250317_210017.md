# NonlinearInteractionExperiment Summary

Date: 2025-03-17 21:00:17

## Description

This experiment tests whether personality exhibits self-reference properties as predicted by the g|Ψ|²Ψ term in the quantum field equation. By analyzing how earlier outputs influence later generations and testing for non-linear response to input perturbations, we can determine whether personality emergence shows the non-linear self-interaction characteristic of quantum fields.

## Key Findings

- Strong temporal autocorrelation (1.13): Personality states show high persistence across the generation sequence, indicating coherent field-like behavior over time.
- Weak self-influence (0.30): Earlier states have limited impact on later states, suggesting minimal self-interaction.
- Non-linearity assessment (0.63): Personality generation shows strongly non-linear (quantum-like). This supports the presence of non-linear self-interaction similar to the g|Ψ|²Ψ term.
- Overall, personality generation shows moderate evidence of non-linear self-interaction properties, with some indicators consistent with quantum field-like behavior. The evidence suggests a mix of linear and non-linear processes in personality emergence.
